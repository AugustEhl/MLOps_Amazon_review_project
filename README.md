# MLOps_Amazon_review_project

## Predicting Amazon Ratings based on review comments

Overall goal: Predict Amazon rating from review comment using PyTorch transformers

PyTorch ecosystem: Transformers

Data: Amazon Reviews (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)

### Project description:
In this project we work with Amazon Reviews data. We will predict ratings of various products in the dataset based on the review comment. To do this we will use the PyTorch ecosystem transformers from Huggingface git repo (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). For this project, we will utilize various tools to make organized and efficient training of deep learning models in Python using various tools presented in the course (https://skaftenicki.github.io/dtu_mlops/).
